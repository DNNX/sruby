# Static Typing for Ruby

Modeled after gradual typing approaches taken by others, this is an attempt to build a source to source compiler for Ruby.
SRuby is a superset langauge that disallows some features of vanilla Ruby in order to provide static typing.

There is a basic infastructure for parsing, and interpretation set up, and the typechecker is the next piece to be implemented.
